# Reddit-GUI-Post-Viewer-

Built a GUI-based Reddit post viewer that lets users search r/linux posts by keyword and interact through shell-based GUI dialogs. Used PRAW to fetch post data from Reddit API, YAD to display results and post details (title, URL, top comment), and subprocess to integrate CLI and GUI. Demonstrated skills in scripting, API usage, and lightweight Linux UI design.
