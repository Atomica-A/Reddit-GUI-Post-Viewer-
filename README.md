# Reddit GUI Viewer

This is a simple Python tool that lets you search Reddit posts from reddit using a graphical interface. It uses the Reddit API to fetch posts and `yad` to show pop-up windows for input and selection. You can enter a keyword, see matching post titles, and view the selected postâ€™s details â€” including the URL, upvotes, and top comment.
